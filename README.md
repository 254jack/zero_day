**First Alx Project ** __First Alx Project__ 
This is the first alx project that requires me to do it on my local machine rather than in the sandbox.


*In order to have the project working on my computer, follow this steps:*


* `cd ~`
* `mkdir zero_day`
* git clone [link] (https://github.com/254jack/zero_day.git)

You can now work on this project from your computer.
